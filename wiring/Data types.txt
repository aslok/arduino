                                                8 bit
boolean         0               1                       simple logical true/false
char            -128            127                     signed number from -128 to 127. The compiler will attempt to interpret
                                                        this data type as a character in some circumstances, which may yield 
                                                        unexpected results
unsigned char   0               255                     same as ‘byte’; if this is what you’re after, you should use ‘byte’ instead, 
byte            unsigned char                           unsigned number from 0-255
                                                        for reasons of clarity

int             -32,768         32,767                  signed number from -32768 to 32767. This is most commonly what you see 
                                                        used for general purpose variables in Arduino example code provided with the IDE
unsigned int    0               65,535                  the same as ‘word’. Use ‘word’ instead for clarity and brevity
word            unsigned int                            unsigned number from 0-65535
                                                32 bit
unsigned long   0               4,294,967,295           unsigned number from 0-4,294,967,295. The most common usage of this is to store 
                                                        the result of the millis() function, which returns the number of milliseconds

long            -2,147,483,648  2,147,483,647           signed number from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
float           -3.4028235E38   3.4028235E38            signed number from -3.4028235E38 to 3.4028235E38. Floating point on 
                                                        the Arduino is not native; the compiler has to jump through hoops to make 
                                                        it work. If you can avoid it, you should. We’ll touch on this later.
